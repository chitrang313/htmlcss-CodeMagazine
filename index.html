    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>Posted by Laura Jones on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
      about, and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
